let hp1_0 = "<h1>Chapter 1: The Boy Who Lived</h1><br><p class=\"indent\"> Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense.</p><p class=\"indent\"> Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.</p><p class=\"indent\"> The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing with a child like that.</p><p class=\"indent\"> When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.<br> None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window.</p><p class=\"indent\"> At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed,</p>"

let hp1_1 = "<p>because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls. \"Little tyke,\" chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.</p><p class=\"indent\">It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar -- a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen -- then he jerked his head around to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn't a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive -- no, looking at the sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day.</p><p class=\"indent\"> But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed in funny clothes -- the getups you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren't young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt -- these people were obviously collecting for something... yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.</p><p class=\"indent\"> Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn't see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open- mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery.</p>"

let hp1_2 = "<p class=\"indent\">He'd forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see a single collecting tin. It was on his way back past them, clutching a large doughnut in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.</p><p>\"The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard yes, their son, Harry\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought better of it.</p><p class=\"indent\">He dashed back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his secretary not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking... no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a sister like that... but all the same, those people in cloaks...</p><p class=\"indent\">He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door. </p><p class=\"indent\">\"Sorry\", he grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak. He didn't seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \"Don't be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\"</p><p class=\"indent\">And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.</p><p class=\"indent\">Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping</p>"

let hp1_3 = "<p>he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve of imagination.</p><p class=\"indent\">As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw -- and it didn't improve his mood -- was the tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.</p><p class=\"indent\">\"Shoo!\" said Mr. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. It just gave him a stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife.</p><p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door's problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (\"Won't!\"). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:</p><p>\"And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.\" The newscaster allowed himself a grin. \"Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls tonight, Jim?\"</p><p>\"Well, Ted,\" said the weatherman, \"I don't know about that, but it's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they've had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters...</p><p class=\"indent\"> Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He'd have to say something to her. He cleared his throat nervously. \"Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't heard from your sister lately, have you?\"</p>"

let hp2_0 = "<h1>Chapter 1: The Worst Birthday</h1><br><p class=\"indent\">Not for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Privet Drive. Mr. Vernon Dursley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, hooting noise from his nephew Harry's room.</p><p>\"Third time this week!\" he roared across the table. \"If you can't control that owl, it'll have to go!\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry tried, yet again, to explain.</p><p>\"She's bored\", he said. \"She's used to flying around outside. If I could her just let her out at night-\"</p><p>\"Do I look stupid?\" snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dangling from his busty mustache. \"I know what'll happen if that owl's let out.\"</p><p class=\"indent\">He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia.</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, loud belch from the Dursley's son, Dudley.</p><p>\"I want more bacon.\"</p><p>\"There's more in the frying pan, sweetums\", said Aunt Petunia, turning misty eyes on her massive son. \"We must build you up while we've got the chance... I don't like the sound of that school food...\"</p><p>\"Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smeltings\", said Uncle Vernon heartily. \"Dudley gets enough, don't you, son?\"</p>"

let hp2_1 = "<p class=\"indent\">Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry.</p><p>\"Pass the frying pan.\"</p><p>\"You've forgotten the magic word,\" said Harry irritably.</p><p class=\"indent\">The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was incredible.</p><p class=\"indent\">Dudley gasped and fell of his chair with a crash that shook the whole kitchen. Mrs. Dursley gave a small scream and clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temple.</p><p>\"I meant please!\" said Harry quickly. \"I didn't mean-\"</p><p>\"WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,\" thundered his uncle, spraying spit over the table. \"ABOT SAYING THE M WORD IN MY HOUSE?\"</p><p>\"But I-\"</p><p>\"HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!\" roared Uncle Vernon, pounding the table with his fist.</p><p>\"I just-\"</p><p>\"I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who was trying to heave Dudley to his feet.</p><p>\"All right,\" said Harry, \"all right...\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Uncle Vernon sat back down, beathing like a winded rhinoceros and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp eyes.</p><p class=\"indent\">Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Uncle Vernon had been treating him like a bomb that might go off at any moment, because Harry Potter wasn't a normal boy. As a matter of fact, he was not normal as it is possible to be.</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry Potter was a wizard-a wizard fresh from his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And if the Dursleys were unhappy to have him back for the holidays, it was nothing to how Harry felt.</p><p class=\"indent\">He missed Hogwarts so much it was like having a constant stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), the mail arriving by owl, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleeping in his four-poster bedin the tower dormitory, visiting the game keeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in the grounds, and, especially, Quidditch, the most popular sport in the wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, and fourteen players on brommsticks).</p><p class=\"indent\">All Harry's spellbooks, his wand, robes, and top-of-the-line Nimbus Two Thousand broomstick had been locked in a cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on the House Quiddich team because he hadn't practiced all summer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school without any of his homework done? The Dursley were what wizards call Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins, and as far as they were concerned, haviong a wizard in the family was a matter of deepest shame. Uncle Vernon had even padlocked Harry's owl, Hedwig, inside her cage, to stop her from carrying messages to anyone in the wizarding world."

let hp2_2 = "<p class=\"indent\">Harry looked nothing like the rest of the family. Uncle Vernon was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt Petunia was horse-faced and bony; Dudley was blond, pink, and porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with brilliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore round glasses, and on his forehead was a thin, lightning-shaped scar.</p><p class=\"indent\">It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry's very mysterious past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys' doorstep eleven years before.</p><p class=\"indent\">At the age of one year old, Harry had somehow survived a curse from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose name most witches and wizards still feared to speak. Harry's parents had died in Voldemort's attack, but Harry had escaped with his lightning scar, and somehow-nobody understood why Voldemort's powers had been destroyed the instant he had failed to kill Harry.</p><p class=\"indent\">So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother's sister and her husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never understanding why he kept making odd things happen without meaning to, believing the Dursleys' story that he had got his scar in the car crash that had killed his parents.</p><p class=\"indent\">And then, exactly a year ago, Hogwarts had written to Harry, and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at wizard school, where he and his scar were famous... but now the school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in something smelly.</p><p class=\"indent\">The Dursleys hadn't even remembered that today happened to be Harry's twelfth birthday. Of course, his hopes hadn't been high; they'd never given him a real present, let alone a cake-but to ignore it completely...</p><p class=\"indent\">At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly and said, \"Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it.</p><p>\"This could well be the day I make the biggest deal of my career,\" said Uncle Vernon.</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Uncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He'd been talking of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge order from him (Uncle Vernon's company made drills).</p><p>\"I think we should run through the schedule one more time,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"We should all be in position at eight o'clock. Petunia, you will be-?\"</p><p>\"In the lounge,\" said Aunt Petunia promptly, \"waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.\"</p><p>\"Good, good. And Dudley?\"</p><p>\"I'll be waiting to open the door.\" Dudley put on a foul, simpering smile. \"May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?\"</p><p>\"They'll love him!\" cried Aunt Petunia rapturously.</p><p>\"Excellent, Dudley,\" said Uncle Vernon. Then he rounded on Harry. \"And you?\" \"I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry tonelessly.</p><p>\"Exactly,\" said Uncle Vernon nastily. \"I will lead them into the lounge, introduce</p>you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight fifteen-\"</p>"

let hp2_3 = "<p class=\"indent\">\"I'll announce dinner,\" said Aunt Petunia.</p><p>\"And, Dudley, you'll say-\"</p><p>\"May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?\" said Dudley, offering his fat arm to an invisible woman.</p><p>\"My perfect little gentleman!\" sniffed Aunt Petunia.</p><p>\"And you?\" said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry.</p><p>\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" said Harry dully.</p><p>\"Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compliments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?\"</p><p>\"Vernon tells me you're a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason... Do tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason...\"</p><p>\"Perfect... Dudley?\"</p><p>\"How about: --We had to write an essay about our hero at school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.--\"</p><p class=\"indent\">This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under the table so they wouldn't see him laughing. \"And you, boy?\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged.</p><p>\"I'll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I'm not there,\" he said.</p><p>\"Too right, you will,\" said Uncle Vernon forcefully. \"The Masons don't know anything about you and it's going to stay that way. When dinner's over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for coffee, Petunia, and I'll bring the subject around to drills. With any luck, I'll have the deal signed and sealed before the News at Ten. We'll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time tomorrow.\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry couldn't feel too excited about this. He didn't think the Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on Privet Drive.</p><p>\"Right-I'm off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for Dudley and me. And you,\" he snarled at Harry. \"You stay out of your aunt's way while she's cleaning.\"</p><p class=\"indent\">Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang under his breath: \"Happy birthday to me... happy birthday to me...\"</p><p class=\"indent\">No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had never felt so lonely. More than anything else at Hogwarts, more even than playing Quidditch, Harry missed his best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They, however, didn't seem to be missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and stay.</p><p class=\"indent\">Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking Hedwig's cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn't worth the risk. Underage wizards weren't allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn't told the Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in the cupboard under the stairs with his wand and broomstick. For the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering nonsense words under his breath and watching"
